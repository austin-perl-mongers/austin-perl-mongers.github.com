<b>A little history thanks to Wayne Walker</b>
<p>
A few of us got together at the Perl Conference 2.0 and decided to start a 
Perl Mongers in Austin. Like a fool I said I'd do it. Well, after much 
procrastination, I asked for a sponsor of an email list and a web page. 
You've found the webpage :)
<p>
The mailing list and web pages came online Septemebr 27, 1998. Don't expect 
miracles or organization yet :)
<p>
[SSZ: It has gotten a lot better!!!!] 
<p>
Thanks to SSZ for hosting the site and the mailing list.

<p>
<b>Some additional information</b>
<p>
The Austin Perl Mongers are supported at two different sites. The original
is at SSZ and the other at Deja.com. There is ongoing discussion as to how
to handle sync'ing the two resources, especialy the mailing list traffic
between the two. For the latest info you will need to join the mailing list
at one of the sites.
<p>
The mailing lists at TAG:SSZ are majordomo managed. This means that all
subscription and unsubscription is handled automaticaly. To subscribe to
a specific list consists of sending majordomo@ssz.com an email with an
empty title and the body consisting of "subscribe mail_list_name". You
will receive in return a description of the mailing list and instructions
on how to unsubscribe. It is important to note that this unsubscription
<b>MUST</b> be sent from the same email address that the subscription was
made from. If you can't automaticaly unsubscribe or you experience other
difficulties then contact lists@ssz.com for manual responce. You should
receive a responce within 24 hours.
<p>
<b>APM Mailing Lists Submission Sites</b>
<p>
We are currently discussing joining the two mailing lists. The primary issue
is endless looping of traffic. We hope to have a method resolved shortly.
In the mean time, you should probably send to <b>both</b> addresses. Sorry
for the inconvenience.

Austin Perl Mongers free resources at Deja.com include:

* Mailing list that is archived, searchable, and has a threaded (web)
  interface so that you can read and post even if you don't have remote
  access to your email
* Online chat (we really should schedule online meetings as well as offline).
* Online poll
* Online notes, for quick scratchings or for your favorite perl one-liner
* Online whiteboard - a chunk of text that anyone can edit - could be used
  for about a billion things, but think of this as the group's bulletin
  board.
* Online web bookmarks - assuming everyone CONTRIBUTES - this is where we can
  file all URLs that are of interest.
* Online web pages via the Homestead service (this is a lot like Geocities)
  and is accessible via the "Our Web Pages" link:
  http://homestead.deja.com/austin_perl_mongers/PerlMongersHome.html
* Online calendar for the group, for marking the next meeting or other
  events that are meaningful to us

Austin Perl Mongers pay resources at Deja.com include:

* News reader access to the newsgroup (mailing list) via Deja.com's personal
  newsreader service (read: your own usenet feed!) - this one is $9.95 per
  month (or $69.95 per year, I believe).  http://bcandid.deja.com/
